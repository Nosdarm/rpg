# To run these tests, you'd typically use `pytest` in your terminal.
# Ensure that the test file is discoverable by pytest (e.g., named test_*.py or *_test.py).
# You might need to configure PYTHONPATH or install your package in editable mode (`pip install -e .`)
# for imports like `from src.core...` to work correctly.
# Also, ensure `asyncio_mode = auto` in pytest.ini or use `pytest-asyncio`.

# pytest.ini example:
# [pytest]
# asyncio_mode = auto
# python_files = test_*.py *_test.py
# testpaths = tests
# log_cli = true
# log_cli_level = INFO
# markers =
#     asyncio
#     slow: marks tests as slow to run
#     serial
# addopts = --strict-markers
# filterwarnings =
#     ignore::DeprecationWarning

# Note: The tests for private functions (_advance_turn, _check_combat_end) are conceptual.
# It's generally better to test private functions via the public interface that uses them.
# However, for complex private logic, direct unit tests (often by temporarily making them non-private
# or using `module._function_name` access) can be useful during development.
# For the final submission, focus on testing the public API (start_combat, process_combat_turn).
# The `_check_combat_end_scenarios` test is good as it tests a critical piece of logic.
