# This file is intentionally left empty after refactoring.
# All master admin commands have been moved to individual cogs
# within the src/bot/commands/master_commands/ directory.

# The original MasterAdminCog and its /master_admin group are no longer used,
# as each new Cog defines its own top-level command group (e.g., /master_player).

# This file can be deleted if no longer referenced, or kept as a placeholder.
# For now, it will be kept empty.
