## Completed Tasks Log

**Task 47: üõ†Ô∏è 15.1 Master Command System**
- **Completed**: 2024-07-18
- **Description**: Implemented a comprehensive Master Command System. This included:
    - Refactoring master commands into individual Cogs per entity.
    - Implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for most major database models (Player, Party, Item, RuleConfig, Ability, Faction, GeneratedNpc, Location, Quest-related models, InventoryItem, Relationship, StatusEffectDefinition, CraftingRecipe, Skill, PlayerNpcMemory, GlobalNpc, MobileGroup).
    - Integrating a `parse_json_parameter` utility for robust handling of JSON inputs in commands.
    - Ensuring all commands operate within the `guild_id` context.
    - Enhancing specific commands with additional functionality (e.g., `faction_update` leader handling, `mobile_group_update` new fields, `quest_progress_update` for `progress_data_json`).
    - Implementing a signaling mechanism for `/master_conflict resolve` to interact with the turn processing module.
    - Ensuring full localization of user-facing messages.
    - Addressing and fixing several linting issues that arose during development.

- **Completed**: [–¢–µ–∫—É—â–∞—è –¥–∞—Ç–∞]
- **Description**: Prepared backend APIs and UI contract for inventory and item management UI.

    - Created/updated TypeScript definitions in `src/ui/src/types/` for `ItemDefinition`, `ItemPayload`, `InventoryItemData`, `EnrichedInventoryItem`, and ensured `Player` & `GeneratedNpc` types can include enriched inventory.
    - Created/updated UI service stubs in `src/ui/src/services/` (`itemService.ts`, `inventoryService.ts`, `playerService.ts`, `npcService.ts`) to reflect new API capabilities and provide a clear interface for UI developers.
    - Documented the relevant API endpoints and data structures for the UI team in `AGENTS.MD`.
