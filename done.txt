## Completed Tasks Log

**Task 64: üñ•Ô∏è UI.10 UI for Monitoring and Logging (Backend Preparation & UI Stubs)**
- **Completed**: [–¢–µ–∫—É—â–∞—è –¥–∞—Ç–∞]
- **Description**: Prepared backend APIs and UI contract (TypeScript definitions, service stubs, basic component placeholders, test file stubs) for UI pages related to monitoring game state (WorldState), viewing event logs (StoryLog), and displaying a game map (Locations).
- **Result**:
    - Analyzed existing Master commands for monitoring (Task 49) and models for StoryLog and Location.
    - Created TypeScript definitions:
        - `src/ui/src/types/monitoring.ts`: `UIStoryLogData`, `UIEventType`, `UIStoryLogFilterParams`.
        - `src/ui/src/types/location.ts`: `UILocationData`, `UILocationType`, `UILocationFilterParams`.
        - Ensured usage of existing `PaginatedResponse` and `RuleConfigEntry`.
    - Created UI service stubs with mock implementations:
        - `src/ui/src/services/monitoringService.ts`: for WorldState and StoryLog.
        - `src/ui/src/services/locationService.ts`: for Locations.
    - Created basic UI component file structure (placeholders) and their test files:
        - `src/ui/src/pages/MonitoringPage/WorldStatePage.tsx` & `.test.tsx`
        - `src/ui/src/pages/MonitoringPage/StoryLogPage.tsx` & `.test.tsx`
        - `src/ui/src/pages/MapPage/MapPage.tsx` & `.test.tsx`
    - Created placeholder unit test files for the new services:
        - `src/ui/src/services/monitoringService.test.ts`
        - `src/ui/src/services/locationService.test.ts`
    - Documented the relevant API endpoints (master commands from Task 49) and data structures for the UI team in `AGENTS.MD` under "–î–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ü–∏—è API –¥–ª—è UI Task 64: –ú–æ–Ω–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–Ω–≥, –õ–æ–≥–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏ –ö–∞—Ä—Ç–∞".
    - Noted that data for other map entities (Players, NPCs, Global Entities) would be sourced via services defined in other UI tasks (Task 57, Task 63).
    - Detailed UI component implementation and full test implementation are pending further UI-specific tasks.

- **Completed**: [–¢–µ–∫—É—â–∞—è –¥–∞—Ç–∞]
- **Description**: Prepared backend APIs and UI contract (TypeScript definitions, service stubs, basic component placeholders, test file stubs) for Global Entity (GlobalNpc, MobileGroup) management UI. UI for GlobalEvent was deferred due to lack of backend master commands.
- **Result**:
    - Analyzed existing GlobalNpc and MobileGroup models, CRUD operations, and Master commands; confirmed API readiness for these entities.

        - `GlobalNpcData`, `GlobalNpcPayload`, `GlobalNpcUpdatePayload`
        - `MobileGroupData`, `MobileGroupPayload`, `MobileGroupUpdatePayload`
        - Utilized common `PaginatedResponse<T>`.
    - Created UI service stubs with mock implementations in `src/ui/src/services/globalEntityService.ts` for CRUD operations on GlobalNpc and MobileGroup.
    - Created basic UI component file structure (placeholders) in `src/ui/src/pages/GlobalEntitiesPage/`:
        - `GlobalNpcListPage.tsx`, `GlobalNpcDetailPage.tsx`
        - `MobileGroupListPage.tsx`, `MobileGroupDetailPage.tsx`
    - Created placeholder unit test files for the new service and page components:
        - `src/ui/src/services/globalEntityService.test.ts`
        - `src/ui/src/pages/GlobalEntitiesPage/GlobalNpcListPage.test.tsx`
        - `src/ui/src/pages/GlobalEntitiesPage/GlobalNpcDetailPage.test.tsx`
        - `src/ui/src/pages/GlobalEntitiesPage/MobileGroupListPage.test.tsx`
        - `src/ui/src/pages/GlobalEntitiesPage/MobileGroupDetailPage.test.tsx`
    - Documented the relevant API endpoints (master commands) and data structures for the UI team in `AGENTS.MD` under "–î–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ü–∏—è API –¥–ª—è UI Task 63: –£–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≥–ª–æ–±–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–º–∏ —Å—É—â–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—è–º–∏ (GlobalNpc, MobileGroup)".
    - Detailed UI component implementation (forms, tables, state management) and full test implementation are pending further UI-specific tasks.

**Task 62: üñ•Ô∏è UI.8 UI for Quest Management (Backend Preparation & UI Stubs)**
- **Completed**: [–¢–µ–∫—É—â–∞—è –¥–∞—Ç–∞]
- **Description**: Prepared backend APIs and UI contract (TypeScript definitions, service stubs) for quest management UI.
- **Result**:
    - Analyzed existing Quest-related models, CRUD operations, and Master commands.
    - Implemented a new Master command `/master_quest progress_create` to allow manual creation of quest progress entries.
    - Wrote unit tests for the new command and fixed several related and unrelated issues in the test suite. Some complex mocking issues were deferred.
    - Created TypeScript definitions in `src/ui/src/types/quest.ts`:
        - `QuestlineData`, `QuestlinePayload`
        - `GeneratedQuestData`, `GeneratedQuestPayload`
        - `QuestStepData`, `QuestStepPayload`
        - `PlayerQuestProgressData`, `PlayerQuestProgressPayload`, `PlayerQuestProgressUpdatePayload`
        - `UIQuestStatus` enum
        - Common `PaginatedResponse<T>`, `LocaleRecord`, `JsonData`.
    - Created UI service stubs with mock implementations in `src/ui/src/services/questService.ts` for all relevant CRUD operations on quest entities.
    - Documented the relevant API endpoints (master commands) and data structures for the UI team in `AGENTS.MD`.
    - Deferred detailed UI component implementation (forms, tables, state management) for future UI-specific tasks.

**Task 47: üõ†Ô∏è 15.1 Master Command System**
- **Completed**: 2024-07-18
- **Description**: Implemented a comprehensive Master Command System. This included:
    - Refactoring master commands into individual Cogs per entity.
    - Implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for most major database models (Player, Party, Item, RuleConfig, Ability, Faction, GeneratedNpc, Location, Quest-related models, InventoryItem, Relationship, StatusEffectDefinition, CraftingRecipe, Skill, PlayerNpcMemory, GlobalNpc, MobileGroup).
    - Integrating a `parse_json_parameter` utility for robust handling of JSON inputs in commands.
    - Ensuring all commands operate within the `guild_id` context.
    - Enhancing specific commands with additional functionality (e.g., `faction_update` leader handling, `mobile_group_update` new fields, `quest_progress_update` for `progress_data_json`).
    - Implementing a signaling mechanism for `/master_conflict resolve` to interact with the turn processing module.
    - Ensuring full localization of user-facing messages.
    - Addressing and fixing several linting issues that arose during development.

    - Improved `/master_item update` command to support updating multiple fields via a single `data_json` parameter.
    - Created/updated TypeScript definitions in `src/ui/src/types/` for `ItemDefinition`, `ItemPayload`, `InventoryItemData`, `EnrichedInventoryItem`, and ensured `Player` & `GeneratedNpc` types can include enriched inventory.
    - Created/updated UI service stubs in `src/ui/src/services/` (`itemService.ts`, `inventoryService.ts`, `playerService.ts`, `npcService.ts`) to reflect new API capabilities and provide a clear interface for UI developers.
