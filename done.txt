## Completed Tasks Log

**Task 57: üñ•Ô∏è UI.3 UI for Player and Character Management (Backend/API Docs, UI Stubs & Tests Verified)**
- **Completed**: [–¢–µ–∫—É—â–∞—è –¥–∞—Ç–∞]
- **Description**: Task 57 is considered complete. Backend preparations (API via master commands, TypeScript types, UI service stubs) were done in "Tasks 57, 58, 59". The current plan involved adding API documentation to `AGENTS.md` and creating UI component/test stubs.
- **Result**:
    - Step 1 (Update AGENTS.md for Task 57 plan): Confirmed complete from `AGENTS.md` log.
    - Step 2 (Add API documentation for UI Task 57 to `AGENTS.md`): Documentation for `/master_player` and `/master_npc` commands, along with relevant TypeScript interfaces, has been added to `AGENTS.md`.
    - Step 3 (Create UI component and test stubs): Verified that the following files and directories already exist, so no new files were created:
        - `src/ui/src/pages/PlayerManagementPage/PlayerListPage.tsx`
        - `src/ui/src/pages/PlayerManagementPage/PlayerListPage.test.tsx`
        - `src/ui/src/pages/PlayerManagementPage/PlayerDetailPage.tsx`
        - `src/ui/src/pages/PlayerManagementPage/PlayerDetailPage.test.tsx`
        - `src/ui/src/pages/NpcManagementPage/NpcListPage.tsx`
        - `src/ui/src/pages/NpcManagementPage/NpcListPage.test.tsx`
        - `src/ui/src/pages/NpcManagementPage/NpcDetailPage.tsx`
        - `src/ui/src/pages/NpcManagementPage/NpcDetailPage.test.tsx`
    - Step 4 (Create UI service test stubs): Verified that the following files already exist, so no new files were created:
        - `src/ui/src/services/playerService.test.ts`
        - `src/ui/src/services/npcService.test.ts`
    - Task 57 has been moved from `Tasks.txt` to this log. The next task in `Tasks.txt` is Task 58.
    - The main deliverable for this task was ensuring the UI development team has the necessary API documentation and that basic file structures for UI components and tests are in place (which they were). Full implementation of UI components and comprehensive tests are part of subsequent, more specific UI tasks.
