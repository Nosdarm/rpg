## Completed Tasks Log

**Task 62: üñ•Ô∏è UI.8 UI for Quest Management (Backend Preparation & UI Stubs)**
- **Completed**: [–¢–µ–∫—É—â–∞—è –¥–∞—Ç–∞]
- **Description**: Prepared backend APIs and UI contract (TypeScript definitions, service stubs) for quest management UI.
- **Result**:
    - Analyzed existing Quest-related models, CRUD operations, and Master commands.
    - Implemented a new Master command `/master_quest progress_create` to allow manual creation of quest progress entries.
    - Wrote unit tests for the new command and fixed several related and unrelated issues in the test suite. Some complex mocking issues were deferred.
    - Created TypeScript definitions in `src/ui/src/types/quest.ts`:
        - `QuestlineData`, `QuestlinePayload`
        - `GeneratedQuestData`, `GeneratedQuestPayload`
        - `QuestStepData`, `QuestStepPayload`
        - `PlayerQuestProgressData`, `PlayerQuestProgressPayload`, `PlayerQuestProgressUpdatePayload`
        - `UIQuestStatus` enum
        - Common `PaginatedResponse<T>`, `LocaleRecord`, `JsonData`.
    - Created UI service stubs with mock implementations in `src/ui/src/services/questService.ts` for all relevant CRUD operations on quest entities.
    - Documented the relevant API endpoints (master commands) and data structures for the UI team in `AGENTS.MD`.
    - Deferred detailed UI component implementation (forms, tables, state management) for future UI-specific tasks.

**Task 47: üõ†Ô∏è 15.1 Master Command System**
- **Completed**: 2024-07-18
- **Description**: Implemented a comprehensive Master Command System. This included:
    - Refactoring master commands into individual Cogs per entity.
    - Implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for most major database models (Player, Party, Item, RuleConfig, Ability, Faction, GeneratedNpc, Location, Quest-related models, InventoryItem, Relationship, StatusEffectDefinition, CraftingRecipe, Skill, PlayerNpcMemory, GlobalNpc, MobileGroup).
    - Integrating a `parse_json_parameter` utility for robust handling of JSON inputs in commands.
    - Ensuring all commands operate within the `guild_id` context.
    - Enhancing specific commands with additional functionality (e.g., `faction_update` leader handling, `mobile_group_update` new fields, `quest_progress_update` for `progress_data_json`).
    - Implementing a signaling mechanism for `/master_conflict resolve` to interact with the turn processing module.
    - Ensuring full localization of user-facing messages.
    - Addressing and fixing several linting issues that arose during development.

**Task 60: üñ•Ô∏è UI.6 UI for Inventory and Item Management (Backend Preparation)**
- **Completed**: [–¢–µ–∫—É—â–∞—è –¥–∞—Ç–∞]
- **Description**: Prepared backend APIs and UI contract for inventory and item management UI.
    - Enhanced `/master_player view` and `/master_npc view` commands to optionally include detailed inventory information.
    - Improved `/master_item update` command to support updating multiple fields via a single `data_json` parameter.
    - Created/updated TypeScript definitions in `src/ui/src/types/` for `ItemDefinition`, `ItemPayload`, `InventoryItemData`, `EnrichedInventoryItem`, and ensured `Player` & `GeneratedNpc` types can include enriched inventory.
    - Created/updated UI service stubs in `src/ui/src/services/` (`itemService.ts`, `inventoryService.ts`, `playerService.ts`, `npcService.ts`) to reflect new API capabilities and provide a clear interface for UI developers.
    - Documented the relevant API endpoints and data structures for the UI team in `AGENTS.MD`.

**Task 61: üñ•Ô∏è UI.7 UI for Faction and Relationship Management (Backend Preparation & UI Stubs)**
- **Completed**: [–¢–µ–∫—É—â–∞—è –¥–∞—Ç–∞]
- **Description**: Prepared backend APIs and UI contract (TypeScript definitions, service stubs, basic component structure) for faction and relationship management UI.
- **Result**:
    - Analyzed existing Faction and Relationship models, CRUD operations, and Master commands; confirmed API readiness.
    - Created TypeScript definitions:
        - `src/ui/src/types/faction.ts`: `FactionLeaderInfo`, `Faction`, `FactionPayload`, `FactionUpdatePayload`.
        - `src/ui/src/types/relationship.ts`: `RelationshipEntityInfo`, `RelationshipData`, `RelationshipPayload`, `RelationshipUpdatePayload`.
        - Common `PaginatedResponse<T>` utilized.
    - Created UI service stubs with mock implementations:
        - `src/ui/src/services/factionService.ts`: CRUD functions for factions.
        - `src/ui/src/services/relationshipService.ts`: CRUD functions for relationships.
    - Created basic UI component file structure (placeholders):
        - `src/ui/src/pages/FactionsPage/FactionsListPage.tsx`
        - `src/ui/src/pages/FactionsPage/FactionDetailPage.tsx`
        - `src/ui/src/pages/RelationshipsPage/RelationshipsListPage.tsx`
        - `src/ui/src/pages/RelationshipsPage/RelationshipDetailPage.tsx`
    - Documented the relevant API endpoints and data structures for the UI team in `AGENTS.MD`.
    - Detailed UI component implementation (forms, tables, state management) is pending further UI-specific tasks.
