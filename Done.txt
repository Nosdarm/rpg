## Completed Tasks Log

**Task 50: üß† 11.1 Dialogue Generation Module (LLM, Multy-i18n, According to Rules)**
- **Completed**: [Current Date, to be filled by agent]
- **Description**: The core functionality for dialogue generation, including `prepare_dialogue_generation_prompt` in `src/core/ai_prompt_builder.py` and `generate_npc_dialogue` in `src/core/dialogue_system.py`, was confirmed to be implemented and covered by existing unit tests. This confirmation is based on the analysis of the codebase and the log in `AGENTS.md` (session 2024-07-26), which states that all 773 project tests were passing and the functionality met basic requirements. No new code changes were made in the current session for this task as it was deemed complete based on prior work.

**Task 47: üõ†Ô∏è 15.1 Master Command System**
- **Completed**: 2024-07-18
- **Description**: Implemented a comprehensive Master Command System. This included:
    - Refactoring master commands into individual Cogs per entity.
    - Implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for most major database models (Player, Party, Item, RuleConfig, Ability, Faction, GeneratedNpc, Location, Quest-related models, InventoryItem, Relationship, StatusEffectDefinition, CraftingRecipe, Skill, PlayerNpcMemory, GlobalNpc, MobileGroup).
    - Integrating a `parse_json_parameter` utility for robust handling of JSON inputs in commands.
    - Ensuring all commands operate within the `guild_id` context.
    - Enhancing specific commands with additional functionality (e.g., `faction_update` leader handling, `mobile_group_update` new fields, `quest_progress_update` for `progress_data_json`).
    - Implementing a signaling mechanism for `/master_conflict resolve` to interact with the turn processing module.
    - Ensuring full localization of user-facing messages.
    - Addressing and fixing several linting issues that arose during development.

Task 48: üõ†Ô∏è 15.2 Balance and Testing Tools (Per Guild).
- Completed: 2024-07-22
- Description: Significantly enhanced the Balance and Testing Tools for Game Masters.
    - Simulation APIs:
        - `/master_simulate check`: Previously implemented and verified.
        - `/master_simulate combat_action`: Previously implemented; `dry_run` parameter functionality verified and its usage in the command confirmed.
        - `/master_simulate conflict`:
            - The core simulation logic in `src/core/conflict_simulation_system.py::simulate_conflict_detection` was deepened.
            - Analysis of `action_processor.py` confirmed it doesn't handle inter-player action conflict generation, so `conflict_simulation_system.py` remains the primary module for this logic.
            - Conflict detection rules are now loaded from `RuleConfig` (keys: `conflict_simulation:rules_same_intent_same_target`, `conflict_simulation:rules_conflicting_intent_pairs`, `conflict_simulation:enable_use_self_vs_take_check`), with defaults provided.
            - Types of detectable conflicts were expanded by adding new default rules (e.g., for "go_to" to an exclusive point, "interact/destroy_object", "talk/use" pairs).
            - Unit tests in `tests/core/test_conflict_simulation_system.py` were updated to reflect `RuleConfig` integration and test new rules.
            - The Discord command `/master_simulate conflict` was updated for more detailed output, including target signatures and action entities.
    - AI Generation Analyzers:
        - `/master_analyze ai_generation`: Previously implemented with basic functionality, including a real AI call option and minor analysis extensions.
- Limitations/Deferred:
    - Further expansion of AI Analyzer logic (for deeper balance, quality, lore checks) remains a potential future enhancement (as noted in AGENTS.md "–û—Ç–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –∑–∞–¥–∞—á–∏").
    - The core components of Task 48, especially the "in-depth conflict simulation" which was explicitly deferred, are now considered complete.

**Task 49: üõ†Ô∏è 15.3 Monitoring Tools (Guild-Scoped)**
- **Completed**: [–î–∞—Ç–∞ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –≤—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –∑–¥–µ—Å—å]
- **Description**: Implemented a suite of commands for Game Masters to monitor game state and history within their guild.
    - Created `MasterMonitoringCog` (`src/bot/commands/master_commands/monitoring_master_commands.py`) and registered it.
    - Implemented `CRUDStoryLog` (`src/core/crud/crud_story_log.py`) for accessing `StoryLog` entries, including basic filtering and pagination.
    - Enhanced `CRUDBase` with a generic `count()` method for pagination.
    - Enhanced `CRUDRuleConfig` with methods for filtering by key prefix (`get_multi_by_guild_and_prefix`, `count_by_guild_and_prefix`).
    - Implemented the following `/master_monitor` sub-commands:
        - `log view <log_id>`: View a specific `StoryLog` entry.
        - `log list [page] [limit] [event_type_filter]`: List `StoryLog` entries with pagination and event type filter.
        - `worldstate get <key>`: View a specific WorldState entry (from `RuleConfig`).
        - `worldstate list [page] [limit] [prefix]`: List WorldState entries with prefix filter and pagination.
        - `map list_locations [page] [limit]`: List locations in the guild.
        - `map view_location <identifier>`: View details of a specific location by ID or static_id.
        - `entities list_players [page] [limit]`: List players.
        - `entities view_player <player_id>`: View player details.
        - `entities list_npcs [page] [limit]`: List GeneratedNPCs.
        - `entities view_npc <npc_id>`: View GeneratedNPC details.
        - `entities list_parties [page] [limit]`: List parties.
        - `entities view_party <party_id>`: View party details.
        - `entities list_global_npcs [page] [limit]`: List GlobalNPCs.
        - `entities view_global_npc <global_npc_id>`: View GlobalNPC details.
        - `entities list_mobile_groups [page] [limit]`: List MobileGroups.
        - `entities view_mobile_group <mobile_group_id>`: View MobileGroup details.
    - All commands are guild-scoped, localized, use pagination where appropriate, and present information in `discord.Embeds`.
    - The `/master_monitor statistics get` command was not implemented due to lack of specific requirements for statistical metrics; this can be a future enhancement.
    - Created basic unit tests in `tests/bot/commands/master_commands/test_monitoring_master_commands.py`.

**Task 51: üß† 11.2 Dialogue Context and Status (Guild-Scoped)**
- **Completed**: [Current Date, to be filled by agent]
- **Description**: Implemented APIs `start_dialogue`, `handle_dialogue_input`, `end_dialogue` in `src/core/dialogue_system.py` to manage dialogue sessions. This includes setting/removing player status (`PlayerStatus.DIALOGUE`), maintaining a temporary in-memory record of active dialogues (`active_dialogues` dictionary storing NPC info and session history), and logging dialogue events (`DIALOGUE_START`, `DIALOGUE_LINE`, `DIALOGUE_END`). Integrated with `Action Processing Module` (`src/core/action_processor.py`): added handlers in `ACTION_DISPATCHER` for "talk"/"start_dialogue" and "end_dialogue" intents; modified `process_player_message_for_nlu` to route player messages directly to `handle_dialogue_input` if the player is in a dialogue state, bypassing NLU and sending NPC responses directly to the player. Basic unit tests for the dialogue APIs were created in `tests/core/test_dialogue_system.py`.
